## Files read
- docs/guides/setup-project.md - Setup guide content.
- docs/repo/local-setup.md - Related setup doc.
- pyproject.toml - Current package version and dev dependencies.
- Makefile - Current setup/check/test commands.

## Metadata updates
No metadata changes.

## Changes made
- Updated version example output from `docsync 0.1.1` to `docsync 0.1.2`.

## Why it was wrong
`pyproject.toml` currently declares version `0.1.2`, so the example output in the guide was stale.
